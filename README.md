# Unity - Tic Tac Toe

You can compile this tech demo yourself using Unity 2021.2 or download it from the [Release](https://github.com/leandroreschke/Unity-TicTacToe/releases/tag/v1.0) section

## Summary
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game, it was made to be a TECH DEMO, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun. 

It has a focus on showing basic knowledge with the Engine, UI and C# programming, as well as VFX and art skills. Everything was made by me, with the exception of the sounds and the algorithm to find the winner, although I've improved and changed it to fit my programming style and code quality standard. 

### This is supposed to be a simple project, not focused on performance or optimization, so there is no inherency, polymorphism or OOP explored here ###
